1.1	SDLC is short for software development lifecycle. 
-p
1.2 When diving a number by 0 an error will occur. 
1.3 The git command that moves ode from the local repository to the remote repository is the git push command. 
1.4 When NULL is shown in a database it means there is no existing value in the dataset. 
1.5 The scrum master will:
	- Coach the members of the scrum team

1.6 Rubber duck debugging – is when you describe the technique to somebody who has little to no experience to help you understand each step. You would use this technique when you are unsure of where to start so break down each step. 
Bug clustering – this involves bringing all the bugs together to help arrive at the solution quicker. An example of when you would use this technique would be if there were multiple bugs for example the website crashed in multiple locations. This technique would then be able to be used to fix the bugs at once. 
1.7 The function would show an error if either input values where not numerical values. cash_given and price must be numbers. An elif statement could be written to say if a non-numerical value is inputted it could return an statement to explain it needs to be numerical. 

1.8 Git branches are representing the development part of the working directory for example they will be involved in the editing or staging process. Git branching involves git branches when a change has been made a new branch is created to show the change.

 a. requirements:
-  a menu to show each item 
- show which food is out of stock
- price of the food
- alerts when food is ready. 

b. considerations and problems:
- make sure there is an alert when the restaurant has run out of food to be able to sell an item on the menu. This needs to be alerted as soon as possible and before another customer orders that item. 
-  total the price of the food items to charge the customer. Could write code which would be able to handle discounts if the customers had a voucher. 
c. tools:
- SQL script to show the list of food items using different tables for different categories of food. 
- python code using loops and statements to show alerts. 
- for loop to run to find the menu items which are in stock 
- if statement to alert if out of stock
